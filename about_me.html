        <h1>(More) About Me</h1>
        <p>After spending 8 years in the US, I am now taking a year off to prepare for the next few years and try out things that I never have the time and knowledge for before studying in the US. Currently I am working on two software projects with two groups of friends, while on the other hand, locking myself up in the darkroom.</p>
        <p>Like many of the undergraduates at Berkeley, I spent my first 2 years at a commnnity college in southern California to prepare for transfer into UC. Unlike many of the transfers, I got into the Engineering Physics major, which only have around 80 students compare to the 1200 students in EECS. After struggling for a year, I began to realize that the only way to make some sense of the diverse curriculum is taking the path of microelectronics, which is not as interesting to me as AI and robotics. Therefore I end up joining the EECS major as well to make it a dual major at the beginning of my senior year.</p>
        <p>Following my B.S. degree from Berkeley, I found myself surrounded by robotics and system theory courses when pursuing the Master of Engineering degree at Cornell University.</p>

        <p>More coming soon.</p>
