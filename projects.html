        <h2>A movie, anime and TV series recommender</h2>
        <h3>July 2015 - Now</h3>
        <p>Web-based movie and TV series recommender that makes recommendations based on user's rating on watched entities using machine learning techniques. Responsible for front end development with AngularJS and recommender written in C++.</p>
        <p>Product is expected to launch by Summer 2016.</p>

        <h1>Directed Research on Coordinated Mobile Robotics</h1>
        <h3>Fall 2014 - Spring 2015</h3>
        <p>Directed research at USC under Prof Nora Ayanian on multi-robot path planning. This is an individual project studying the most efficient (and computationally light) method for guiding a group of ground robots to move along their own preset paths without colliding into each other. Code written in Python (main program and planning, visualization using matplotlib) and MATLAB (visualization.)</p>

        <h1>Directed Research on Natural Language Processing</h1>
        <h3>Summer 2014</h3>
        <p>Directed research at USC under Prof Kenji Sagae on parsing morphologically rich languages (SPMRL Shared Task 2014.) This is a team project and my task was exploring various method on breaking up long sentence in Arabic and Hebrew into sequence of meaningful words. Code written in Python.</p>
